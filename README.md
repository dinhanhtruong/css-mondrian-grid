# CSS Mondrian Grid
![responsive snapping](/responsive_demo.gif)

I used CSS Grid Layout to make fully responsive Mondrian-style grids of images that *automatically* resize and re-snap to fill as much contiguous area as possible depending on the viewport width. The images' aspect ratios remain constant, and their bounding windows instead resize to conceal the image to prevent distortion.  
Images were personally taken in MSFS 2020.
